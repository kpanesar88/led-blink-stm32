# STM32 LED Blink Project

A simple project to make the onboard LED of an STM32F446RE Nucleo board blink, used to verify that the board is working correctly.

## Description

This project demonstrates basic GPIO usage on the STM32F446RE using the STM32CubeIDE framework. The onboard LED (PA5) blinks on and off with a 1-second delay. It's a starting point for learning embedded programming with STM32 microcontrollers.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **STM32 Nucleo F446RE** board
- **STM32CubeIDE** for project creation, code writing, and flashing
- **STM32CubeMX** for pin and peripheral configuration
- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) Library** for GPIO control
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
3. Build the project.
4. Flash it to your STM32 Nucleo board using the built-in ST-LINK debugger.
5. Observe the onboard LED blinking.
